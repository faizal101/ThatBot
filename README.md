# ThatBot
A personal Disocrd bot built using discord-py

I'm pretty new to programming and I decided to make a Discord bot using the rewrite version of discord-py.
It's a pretty simple bot. For now. More features would obviously be added over time, when I know how to do X or Y.

I'm aware my code is all over the place. But like I said, i'm new to programming and building bots. But it'll definetely improve over time. Iâ€“I hope.

I don't know why but if you want to add this bot to your server, for whatever reason, then feel free I guess.

also, send me yuri pics via Discord DMs thank :^)
