  ### Notes

  Lines starts at '0'. So line 14 `### Notes` would be `lines[13]`
  `.split('\n')[0]` is used as there's a new line at the end of the sentence (obviously).
  Not saving that would result in the variable having the new line, which we don't want.
  The reason I'm listing my pathname here instead of in the actual code is because:
  –My computer and VPS obviously have different paths.
  –Changing the pathname every time is a drag.
  –I sometimes forget to change the pathname.
  –It's easy to change the pathname at any time, without the need to stop the bot or something. I guess.
